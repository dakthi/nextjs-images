# Pastel Coquette — Social Caption (UK)

Coquette, but keep it pastel and polished.

🎀 Soft ribbons of colour, whisper‑thin French, micro‑bows
🌸 Baby pinks, milky lilacs, pistachio mints — airy and romantic
✨ One‑coat payoff, smooth application, no brush marks

Here's how to spot a coquette:
- Sheer pink base with lace‑thin French and a single bow gem
- Milky lilac with micro‑floral decals on ring fingers
- Pistachio pastel with a blushing half‑moon

Keep it sweet, balanced, and unmistakably coquette.
