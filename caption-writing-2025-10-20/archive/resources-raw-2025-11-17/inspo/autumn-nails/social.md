# Autumn Nails — Inspo Caption (UK)

Autumn nails, but make it quietly luxurious.

🍂 Think warm browns, smokey berry, russet reds
🧶 Cosy textures: creamy opaques, soft jellies, satin sheens
✨ Minimal nail art: slim French, micro‑florals, tonal gradients

Style cues to try this week:
- Chocolate base with a slim latte French
- Sheer berry jelly over a nude for depth
- Chestnut ombré with a satin topcoat

Keep it pared‑back, polished, and seasonally chic.
