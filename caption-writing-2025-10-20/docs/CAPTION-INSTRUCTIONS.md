Tone and rules (must follow)
- Professional, technical, elegant, and approachable; education-first.
- Emphasize performance, technique, safety; avoid price-only messaging.
- Only make claims present in the loaded files. No unverified benefits.
- Keep copy concise and useful to salon pros; prefer specifics over hype.

Product naming conventions
- Use full product names, not abbreviations
- "Dipping & Ombré" (not "Dip & Ombré")
- "Gel Polish" (not "Gel")
- "Bold Berry" (not "BoldBerry") - two words
- "Strong Build" (not "StrongBuild") - two words
- "Flexi Build" (not "FlexiBuild") - two words
- Always match official product naming from brand knowledge base

Required footer (append to every caption)
- 💎 Join our members' list at vldirect.uk for early drops and exclusive offers.
- 💅 VLDirect — beauty that makes sense for the tech.
- 📲 Follow @vldirectuk on Instagram for pro tips, trends, and tech-focused education.
- Default CTA: Shop BlazingStar at vldirect.uk today.

**Important:** Instagram handle is @vldirectuk (no dot), website is vldirect.uk (with dot)

Collection CTA wording
- Prefer “shades” over “edit”. Example: “Shop the Old Money shades at vldirect.uk today!”
- Use “Edit” only if explicitly requested for an editorial series.

Input pattern examples
- “Write an Instagram caption for BlazingStar shade 508 (Old Money vibe).”
  - Load: brand README; gel-polish README; Old Money README (if relevant); top coat/base coat if referenced.
- “Write a caption for BlazingStar Maxx Perform Liquid (Winter Formula).”
  - Load: brand README; sculpting-system/liquids README; maxx-perform-liquid README; acrylic-powder README (optional pairing).

Output checklist
- One to three short paragraphs or bullets (platform-appropriate).
- Use correct product names and variants.
- If technique is mentioned, include the relevant system step (e.g., “cure under BlazingStar LED”, “pair with Revive Base”).
- Append the Required footer verbatim.

Preferred caption structure (use this format)
- Title line (H1): `# <Collection/Brand> — Social Caption (<Edit/Theme>)`
- Hook line: 1-2 sentences that explains WHY this matters to the tech/technique — how it solves a technical problem or improves the work. Keep it extremely short and punchy.
- Optional second line: Brand positioning statement or product-line context (e.g., "Build fast, build strong and build flexible with BlazingStar Builder Gels.")
- Two to three bullets (emoji-led), each one concrete feature/benefit/application. Prefer quality over quantity — use 2 bullets if that's all you need.
- Required footer (three lines), appended verbatim.

**Hook line principles:**
- **Extremely short** — aim for under 10-12 words for single line (can extend to 15 if connecting feature to specific benefit)
- **Address objections/assumptions directly** — use pattern: "[Thing] doesn't mean [misconception]" or "You shouldn't have to choose between [X] and [Y]"
- **Connect features to benefits** — "[Number/Feature] means [Benefit outcome]" (e.g., "32 shades mean 32 ways to create trending nail art")
- **Keep it concise** — don't over-explain the benefit; trust the reader to understand (e.g., "32 ways to create nail art" not "32 ways to create nail art without hand-painting skills")
- **Add confident follow-up when appropriate** — add "This is proof." or similar to strengthen claim
- **Can include brand/product line context** — second line can reference broader product family (e.g., "Build fast, build strong and build flexible with BlazingStar Builder Gels.")
- Focus on technical advantage, not just features
- Answer: "Why does this make sense for the work I'm doing?"
- **Frame positively** — focus on what you gain (efficiency, results) not just what you save (price, time)
- Use exclamation marks sparingly — only for enthusiastic, fun products
- Match tone to product type (professional/serious vs trendy/fun)
- End with period, not question mark (statement of fact, not question)
- Can be 1-2 lines: objection/claim, then optional brand positioning or proof statement

**Content principles:**
- Remove redundant details — if the hook mentions value, don't repeat "value pricing" in bullets
- Simpler language over technical jargon when possible
- Remove unnecessary qualifiers (e.g., "not harsh" — just say "protective")
- 2-3 bullets is fine — quality over quantity
**Hook line examples:**

❌ **Bad examples:**
- "240 colours, clean application" (just lists features)
- "240 colours shouldn't mean 240 price tags" (negative framing, focuses on price not benefit)
- "32 shades mean 32 ways to create trending nail art without hand-painting skills" (over-explains: 14 words, too much detail)
- "TPO/HEMA-free formula protects sensitive clients without compromising coverage or wear — expand your client base safely" (too wordy: 17 words)
- "Magnetic effect means intricate nail art without hand-painting skills" (over-explains: 10 words)
- "Thicker structures without the wait" (vague promise: 5 words but unclear)

✅ **Good examples:**
- "Safe doesn't mean compromising coverage or wear." (8 words, addresses objection)
- "Strong doesn't mean thick." (4 words, addresses assumption)
- "Wide shade range without the wide price tag." (8 words, addresses value objection)
- "Magnetic effect made easy!" (4 words, enthusiastic, clear promise)
- "Dimension without hassle." (3 words, addresses ease concern)
- "Gentle formulas can still deliver. This is proof." (8 words, 2 sentences, confident claim + proof)
- "32 shades mean 32 ways to create trending nail art." (9 words, connects feature to benefit, concise)
- "240 colours mean 240 ways to cut your service time when working with coloured acrylic nails." (15 words, connects feature to specific benefit with context)
- "You shouldn't have to choose between structure and service time. Build fast, build strong and build flexible with BlazingStar Builder Gels." (2 lines: objection + brand positioning, 26 words total)
- "Coloured powder eliminates guesswork — see exactly what you're building" (10 words, explains technical benefit)
