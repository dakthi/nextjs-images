# Autumn Berry Bridal Edit — Social/Post Copy

Here’s to brides who love a little depth: autumn berries that feel modern, polished, and impossibly romantic.

## Featured Shades
- Cranberry Veil — sheer berry glow
- Velvet Plum — plush, refined depth
- Rosy Claret — bridal‑soft red

## Why We Love It For Fall
Richer berries read elegant and intentional in cooler light. They pair with satin, lace, and soft tailoring without overpowering.

## How To Wear
- One coat for a whisper‑soft tint
- Two coats for ceremony‑ready polish
- Gloss topcoat for a glassy finish in photos
