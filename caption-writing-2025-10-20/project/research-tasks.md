# Research & Testing Tasks

## Lamps & Curing Systems

### Test All Lamps
- [ ] Test all lamp models we're currently selling
- [ ] Document actual performance vs. specifications
- [ ] Note any issues or limitations

### Research Wavelength Specifications
- [ ] Research wavelength (nm) for all lamp brands in inventory
- [ ] Document UV vs LED specifications
- [ ] Note power output (watts) for each model
- [ ] Verify manufacturer claims

### Gel Polish Pairing
- [ ] Document how each lamp pairs with:
  - BlazingStar Gel Polish
  - MBerry Gel Polish
  - Bold Berry Gel Polish
  - Pastel Gel Polish
- [ ] Test cure times for each polish/lamp combination
- [ ] Note any compatibility issues

### Curing Science & Safety
- [ ] Research: Does UV light overcuring harm gel polish?
  - Effects on durability
  - Effects on flexibility/brittleness
  - Color stability/yellowing
  - Optimal cure time vs. overcure threshold
- [ ] Document proper curing guidelines for each product
- [ ] Note any warnings about overcuring for specific formulas

### Documentation Updates Needed
- [ ] Compile all research findings into a summary document
- [ ] Include photos of test results (if applicable)
- [ ] Create summary spreadsheet with all lamp specifications
- [ ] Document lamp/polish pairing recommendations
