 Clean prep, cleaner lines: set every set up for success with precise plate work.

  - Gentle lift: Use the pusher at a shallow angle to lift and sweep back the cuticle without gouging the plate
  - Targeted removal: Fine-tip nipper trims only non‑living tissue for a neat, even margin
  - Adhesion ready: Finish with cleanse and dehydrate before base to reduce lifting and improve wear
